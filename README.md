# TASK-SCHEDULING-OPTIMIZATION-USING-GLOWWORM-SWARM-OPTIMIZATION

Task scheduling is a critical problem in parallel and distributed computing systems, aiming to efficiently allocate tasks to processors to minimize overall execution time or makespan. 
In this project, I am exploring explore the application of Glowworm Swarm Optimization (GSO) to solve the task scheduling problem in a parallel computing environment.
